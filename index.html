The sky shoots pineapples with a machinegun. Another day says goodbye to the shooter. A fly is often one floor above you. he body of mind comes asking for bread. Chair number eleven does not make any sense. A great silence wants to set things right. The nonsense generator creates random, and often downright bizarre, sentences. Simply press one of the generation buttons below. "Generate!" changes the entire sentence, while "Noun!" and "Verb!" changes half of the current sentence.. Most people believe that a ribbon about some boy cooks cheese grits for the midwife, but they need to remember how somewhat the cream puff strokes. A wobbly trombone finds subtle faults with an omphalos. If a hand caricatures the almost placid menagé à trois, then the bicep leaves. He called her Nimbo (or was it Kafka?). At StupidStuff.ORG, we firmly believe that a certain amount of utter nonsense is a good thing. A daily dose of nonsense can help keep things in perspective. So as a public service, we offer the Utter Nonsense Generator© page, where you can come whenever you feel the need. Utter Nonsense© is also great for baffling people in email, or confounding idiots on a message board or chat room.
